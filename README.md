# java-webapp-tomcat-aad
Aim of this repo is to manage various Java web projects to test various authentication and authorisation features, with a focus on Azure Active Directory integration.

This repo was cloned from another Repo here https://github.com/cvugrinec/microsoft/tree/master/java-webapp-tomcat-aad/ and is linked to a video on Youtube demo'ing the project here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i61I3muADDA.  I had to make a few changes to get the project working again as the tool versions are old and the container used wasn't available.

Managed to create a new Azure Active Directory tenant and then logon with those details in the Java project.  I deleted other projects that I wasn't interested in.
